Interest
======
In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for physical and intellectual sports. I am an excellent tennis player, cyclist, and sprinter. I have been an RC plane modeller for my entire life, and I fondly remember building and flying my very first large nitro RC aeroplane back in 1999. Since then, I have worked with various RC planes, from F3A to F3C, which has furthered my interest in aviation.

------
Please let me know if you are interested in playing tennis. I would classify myself as an intermediate/advanced player with an NTRP rating of around 4.0. I share my love for tennis with [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/616742cf000000000201bd6a?xhsshare=CopyLink&appuid=616742cf000000000201bd6a&apptime=1688393052).

Next Work Out
------
I have a wide range of hobbies that I am passionate about, and work hard to support them. Although I may need to put my hobbies on hold for a great opportunity temporarily, I remain committed to pursuing them in the long run. This is a fundamental part of my identity - I enjoy simple things. In 2023, I am preparing for the NC500 and cross-Italy bikepacking challenge in Scotland and Italy.
