Education
======
* Ph.D in Aerospace Propulsion, Gas Turbine Performance Modelling, Cranfield University, 2021
	* Fully funded and supported by AVIC (now AECC) (1):
  * Interstage Reheat Research Project Outline (2):

* MS.c. in Aeronautical Engineering, Imperial College London, 2015

Work experience
======
* 2022-current: Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Politecnico di Milano
  * Designed and constructed an innovative, cost-effective, and incredibly compact test solution for performing on-line strain collection of gear teeth. This groundbreaking solution is closely linked to the PRIN project.

* 2016-2021: Aero Gas Turbine Diagnostics Software Developer at Cranfield University
	* Developed gas turbine simulation and diagnostics software (PYTHIA). Constructed customized simulation, data processing, and diagnostics modules for the system using the C# language. Integrated the software with GUI and data visualization.
	* Optimized code structures with three packages (.Classes, .Forms, .Functions) that permit easy upgrading and updating of the software without modifying the entire code.
	* Validated the software performance through correlations between simulations and test-bed data.
	* Compiled various technical reports on research methodologies, preliminary simulation results, troubleshooting guidelines, and improvement plans.
	* Coordinated monthly meetings and feedback sessions with project customers on urgent issues.
   
 * 2015-2016: Senior Engineer (Aerodynamicist) at [XAG](https://www.xa.com/en)
	* The scope of my work includes Propeller-Motor Performance Matching, Airframe structure test-rig design, Novel aircraft configuration design, Applying CFD techniques for the entire P20 Quadcopter, and developing an invented damper system to removing specific high-frequency vibrations (a passive solution for Flight Control Module noise reduction).
My research focuses on using CFD techniques to study the aerodynamic behaviour of propellers, enabling engineers to understand the flow path of the drone. This research has the potential to contribute to aeroacoustic (lower-noise propeller design) and higher-efficiency airframe design under different ambient conditions and with various propeller options.

	*  During the design phase, industrial engineers can detect changes in the aerodynamic pressure on the top of the airframe to prevent undesired induced vibrations. Additionally, distributing a pesticide nozzle under the prop is beneficial for mixing purposes, particularly in precision agriculture. However, simulating the nozzle mechanism is still challenging due to the unclear process of liquid drop breakup for different liquid properties such as density, viscosity, and surface tension. Designers can solve this problem using the volume of the fluid method. The closed-loop control of the nozzle produces a perfect liquid particle size according to a given pattern to reduce drift and evaporation.
 
 *  Summer 2013: Heavy Lift Aircraft Design Collaborator at Northwestern Polytechnical University
